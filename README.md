# 📊 Marketing Performance Analysis using Python

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on analysing digital marketing data to understand how marketing campaigns perform across different platforms. The aim is to convert raw data into meaningful insights that can help improve marketing decisions.

The analysis tracks the complete marketing funnel:
**Visitors → Leads → Site Visits → Closures**,  
and evaluates how effectively marketing spend leads to business outcomes.

## 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Understand marketing performance across platforms and campaigns  
- Analyse marketing spend, visitors, leads, and closures  
- Measure conversion rates at each funnel stage  
- Identify top-performing and underperforming adsets  
- Detect unusual trends or spikes in data  
- Present insights using clear visualisations  

**Columns:**
- Date  
- Platform  
- Adset  
- URL  
- Spend  
- Visitors  
- Leads  
- SiteVisits  
- Closure  
- Project  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualisation  
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔍 Work Done in This Project  

### Data Preparation  
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
- Converted date values and sorted data by date  
- Generated summary statistics for better understanding  

### Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Analysed performance by platform, project, adset, and URL  
- Calculated **Cost per Lead (CPL)**  
- Identified campaigns with high and low efficiency  

### Funnel Analysis  
Calculated conversion metrics to understand user movement:
- Visitor to Lead conversion  
- Lead to Site Visit conversion  
- Site Visit to Closure conversion  

This helped identify where users drop off in the funnel.

### Performance & Trend Analysis  
- Platform-wise analysis of spend, visitors, leads, and closures  
- Daily trend analysis for spend and visitors  
- Identified best-performing adsets based on closures  

### Anomaly Detection  
- Identified days with unusually high or low visitors or leads  
- Used statistical thresholds to detect anomalies  

### Advanced Analysis  
- Correlation analysis between key metrics  
- Created daily performance summary tables  
- Built project-wise funnel summaries  

## 📊 Visualisations  
- Daily spend trends by platform  
- Spend vs Leads scatter plot  
- Average closures per platform  
- Visitors trend comparison across platforms  
- Platform-wise performance dashboards  

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Higher marketing spend does not always result in higher closures  
- Some platforms perform better at converting leads to closures  
- Funnel analysis highlights stages where improvements are needed  
- Anomaly detection helps identify unusual performance days
